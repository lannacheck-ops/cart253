I love the color palette of the game especially the greens on the title screen and the reds on the game over screen. The interaction is simple yet addictive. I found myself retrying over and over again to beat my high score. I really liked the idea of giving the player strikes each time the black flies fly out of the screen. It gives another layer of challenge for the player to push themselves to get as many flies as they can before reaching three strikes. Also, the sound effects add really good feedback to warn players they are accumulating strikes. Lastly, the frog fun facts on the game failed screen were a fun and interesting addition that gave me a quick break before playing again to beat my high score!

The aesthetics of this game are really cute and playful! I found it interesting that the levels got easier as you went up, which is something that isn’t usually done in games. I felt like having only the black and golden flies in the end was the game telling me: “You can redeem yourself by accumulating as many points as possible now!” Since the levels didn’t get harder, I didn’t feel as rushed in this game because I was able to gather flies without losing points in the end. The interactions were simple in this game and kept true to the original frogfrogfrog game with the major difference being the level changes. 

I enjoyed seeing how the frog’s color changed based on which fly it ate. I liked seeing how the frog’s body turned transparent when it ate the red flies and when it turned yellow after eating the golden flies. The timer was a great way to differentiate the level changes because it challenges the player to get as many flies as possible before the timer runs out.

The start screen of this game is so beautiful! The text fading in and out and cloud movement is such a cool addition that is visually satisfying. I love how the game is restricted to 60 seconds because it requires skill to catch the flies, not luck since clicking randomly might waste more time. I love the fly movement in this game because it really captures the swiftness of flies in real life and this swiftness is one of the main challenges in this game. Also, the frog’s eyes following the fly is nice addition!

I think this game also excelled in the way it displayed the timer on the screen. The timer was displayed with large numbers in the middle of the screen with the same fade in and out animation as the title screen, but these elements don’t distract the player from the main gameplay. Instead, it keeps the player on track to focus on catching the flies while having a constant reminder of how much time is left. Overall, the game’s aesthetics were very successful!
